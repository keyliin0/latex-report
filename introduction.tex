In a world where information technology is constantly evolving, digitalization is becoming a necessity in order to be able to respond to the pressure of progress in every area of life.
Among these areas is the enterprise management sector, where information technology is becoming increasingly important in order to keep pace with the rapid growth in demand while maintaining a balance with the quality of supply.

Indeed, today's businesses are both vigilant and concerned to remain competitive despite the complexity of the mission given the plurality of functional processes. And because the organization is increasingly seen as a company with its classic management challenges, the implementation of software technologies is presented first and foremost as a management solution, even before addressing specifically travel services.

The Integrated Management Software Package called ERP is a solution for the modernization of the management system because of its ability to bring together the management of different business processes around a single system.

For our client, the management of all its activities is done manually or through a basic application that does not really cover its needs for scalability. It is within this framework that our end-of-study project within the company VatoSmart is part of and which aims at optimizing the whole management of the employees' activity around the same information system using the Odoo integrated management software package.
