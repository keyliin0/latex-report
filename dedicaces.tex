From the bottom of my heart, I dedicate this work\\
\textbf{To my dear parents}, for their constant support, for their infinite trust
and their incessant encouragement. No dedication will be enough
to express my love and respect for you. I will always be
grateful for your sacrifice and your faith. May God bless you and you preserves a long life full of love and happiness.\\
\textbf{To my closest friends}, who have supported me, and with whom I have
shared my funniest moments. Words are not enough to express my
gratitude and my affection for you.\\
\textbf{To my teachers}, who have patiently shared their knowledge and
have helped me in my pursuit of success. My respect for you is
perpetual. May God protect you.
