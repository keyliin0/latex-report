\section{Implementation}
\subsection{Create an exam}
The instructor can manage and create an exam by clicking on the course and visiting the exam menu. An exam is composed of questions and questions have multiple answers and only one of them is correct.

To create a question, the instructor just needs type in the question and click add a question button which will fire a request to the server and in return we get the question data, we add that to the redux state to update the interface.

The user can also delete questions or answers which will make a request to delete the corresponding record and upon a successful request we remove the data the from redux state to update the interface.

    \label{fig:exam_form}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Apply to become an instructor}
If the current logged in user is not an instructor and tries to visit the instructor dashboard, he will be redirected to the instructor application form page.
When the user types the required form data and submits it, we request two upload url from the server and start uploading the cv and the video. Once it's done, we make a request to the server to save the submitted data.
